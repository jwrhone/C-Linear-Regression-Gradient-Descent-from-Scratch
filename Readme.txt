How to run MachineLearningProject.exe

"dataNoLatLon.csv" must be in the same directory of MachineLearningProject.exe.

Step 1.)
	Press the "(1) Generate Linear Regression Gradient Descent Model" button to begin fitting model with dataset. 
	*Note: Will take approximately 3 minutes. You will be prompted when the model is finished fitting.
	**Optional: Select the "Use Pre-Generated Model (Gradient Descent)" checkbox at the top to skip the training time and use the best case model parameters I trained myself.
Step 2.)
	Select desired location from the "(2) Location Select" list.
Step 3.)
	Select the month from the "(3) Select Month" list.
Step 4.)
	Enter the mean temperature of the day in the "(4) Enter Mean Temperature (F°)" textbox.
Step 5.) 
	Enter the minimum temperature of the day in the "(5) Enter Minimum Temperature (F°)" textbox.
Step 6.)
	Press the "(6) Predict Temperature" button.

After these steps the locations elevation, the model's mean absolute error, the model's regression formula, and the models maximum temperature prediction will appear in the corresponding textboxes.

Repeat steps 2-6, or close the application to quit.
